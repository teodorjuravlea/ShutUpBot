# ShutUpBot [WIP]

This is a Discord bot running as a .NET Core application (made with the Discord.NET library)
that sends a message when someone talks too much and reacts with an emoji on subsequent messages.

Set the Discord Bot Token using the DISCORD_TOKEN environment variable.
Set the used emote using the EMOTE_NAME environment variable.
